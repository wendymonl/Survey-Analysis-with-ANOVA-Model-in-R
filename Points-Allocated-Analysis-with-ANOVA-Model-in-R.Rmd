## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r summary}
summary(cars)
```


##Test of Normality 
```{r qqplot, echo=FALSE}
qqnorm(Community_Health_Center_Survey_dataset$`Points Allocated (out of 100)`, main='QQ plot for points')
new.plot
qqline(Community_Health_Center_Survey_dataset$`Points Allocated (out of 100)`, col='red')
```
## Gender Analysis
```{r gender bar and box plots, echo=FALSE}
barplot(table(Community_Health_Center_Survey_dataset$gender), ylab='Frequency', main='Counts of Gender Representation', col='dark blue')
boxplot(Community_Health_Center_Survey_dataset$`Points Allocated (out of 100)`~Community_Health_Center_Survey_dataset$gender, ylab='Points' ,xlab='Gender', main= "Points Allocated to Opening a Community Health Center")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
